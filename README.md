<!--
Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis using Network-Guided Block Covariance Matrix
-->

Sparse linear discriminant analysis using network-guided block covariance matrix (bslda), which allows researchers to utilize prior network information to guide structure of covariance matrix.
'bslda' package provides computationally efficient and user friendly interface to fit the bslda models. 

```
library(bslda)
package?bslda
class?bslda
